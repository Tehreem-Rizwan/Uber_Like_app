# uber_like_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is a basic Uber-like application developed using Flutter. It simulates a ride request feature with a user interface displaying the user's location, a list of nearby drivers, and functionality to request a ride. The app uses dummy data to simulate backend interactions and does not require actual backend services.

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
